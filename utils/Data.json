The main areas of development are supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning. Auxiliary applications such as Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing are also major cornerstones of development, and the ultimate goal of the lab is to familiarise themselves with a vast array of machine learning and deep learningalgorithms.",
